# Mood Tracker: a practical console app

## ‚ú® Introduction
This repository showcases the **MoodTracker** console application, a lab exercise I completed as part of my **IBM Java Professional Developer** course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/java-developer). This project provided an invaluable
opportunity to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skill Honing
The foundational code for this exercise was initially provided, but I extensively refactored and enhanced it to align with best practices in software engineering, as I learned throughout the course. My primary
objective was to implement better **code management** via a strong emphasis on **modularity**, utilizing **helper methods**, and ensuring the overall application followed the principles of **clean code**.
Furthermore, I incorporated **safe coding practices**, utilizing `try-catch` blocks and a superior **custom Exception** (`InvalidMoodException`) to build a more robust and resilient application.

To offer immediate utility and demonstrate deployment capabilities, I have also provided a standalone **JAR file**, which I personally created. This showcases practical skills in file exporting and packaging
a complete application within the JAVA environment.

## üí° Lessons Learned
This **hands-on practice** with a substantial project designed by **IBM**'s corporate tutors deepened my understanding across several key areas, as I successfully completed the corresponding module of the course. <br> <br>
You can verify my [IBM module: Object Oriented Programming in Java here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/VAGF7OPDL74Y) <br> <br> <br>
Throughout the course, and this particular module, I gained significant knowledge in:
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**, refining my approach to modular and clean design
- Solidifying my grasp of **secure development principles** while working within the **JDK** ecosystem
- Actual deployment of an executable JAR application

## üöÄ Looking ahead
The insights gained from this project, particularly regarding **safe coding** and the importance of **code block modularity** (whether through dedicated helper methods or other architectural considerations), will
be foundational elements guiding my continuous growth in the software engineering field and continuous learning journey.

## üíª How to Run the App

To run the Mood Tracker console application:

1.  Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  Download the `MoodTrackerApp.jar` file from this repository.
3.  Execute the application by double-clicking or through console, in the directory of the downloaded .jar file:
```bash
java -jar MoodTrackerApp.jar
```
